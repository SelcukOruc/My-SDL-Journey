# My-SDL-Journey
My amateur and hobbyist interest in C++ and SDL
I have always been interested in low-level coding. In my free times i decided to learn what are the underlying fundementals of making a game
and get accustom to c++'s syntax apart from learning new things such as pointers. 
First, based on only SDL documents I have created my first project 'Pong'
Later, I combined OOP knowledge from unity 3d (C#) and made the game 'The Bricks'. However, i realized that it was full of memory leaks
and implementation of header files were critically wrong.
Finally, I have learnt better way of implementing header files and underlying idea behind animation with tiles and implemented in the game 'Dino'. 
As to memory leaks, i am not %100 sure that i haven't caused any memory leak but i have learnt so much things about memory leaks and tried to pay attention.

From time to time i am planing to do projects in c++, if i have free time; i will try to learn OpenGL.
Normally i would try to fix my mistakes and bugs in previous games (Pong and Bricks) but i will keep them as they are. 
So that i can see my mistakes over and over again and pay more attention not to do them again.
